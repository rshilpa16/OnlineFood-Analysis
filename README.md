# Insights

A single page dashboard created in Excel.

Following inferences can be drawn from the dashboard;

### [1] Feedback 

      Count of Feedback = 388
      Feedback percentage given by Male = 59%
      Feedback percentage given by Female = 41%

      This conclude that Males are more active to give feedback in comparison of Females
      Highest number of positive feedback given by people with age = 65

### [2] Order

       Percentage of Order with Family size 1 = 6%
       Percentage of Order with Family size 2 = 26%
       Percentage of Order with Family size 3 = 30%
       Percentage of Order with Family size 4 = 16%
       Percentage of Order with Family size 5 = 14%
       Percentage of Order with Family size 6 = 8%

       Here, most number of order are from family size 3 where as with family size 6 have only 8% of                          
       order which indicates that it is not necessary that if family members are more then they would 
       order more food.
